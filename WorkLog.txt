New name on project, "Rockwell".
Need to complete the 'MutatorTest' before starting to implement the newly tested functions.

2018-01-21
Make the tests for 'Mutator' to pass. (May also need to write more tests for 'Mutator')

2018-01-28
Added new function to genome, getNodeSUpplyers, needed later to avoid create loop-conection genes during mutation.
Mutator is gonna need some refractoring/Clean-up, can tell that duplicated code is coming up...
The mutator tests may need to be looked-over, but should be ok. Ready to implemetn the LAST PARTS OF MUTATOR½!!

Got the three Mutator tests to pass (testNewNode, innovationNumber, newConnection). So I think 'New Node' and 'New Connection'
mutations are working. Next up is to write tests for the other mutations, maybe also write more tests for the above mentioned
mutations as well, 3 tests doesn't feel too trustworthy... PRogräss änna!

Finished working on the mutator, didn't add more tests (Brinner in the knutarna änna), started working on the GenomeCrossover,
need to finnish its tests and implement it. After that some spieces functionality need to be done and after that its just to
implement the 'Population', gettin closeeee.

2018-06-07
Continued work on the Crossover, soon complete :3. Next up after that is to work on the 'Population' and spieces, but it's gettin close
ÄNNA.

2018-06-10
Finished the SpicesFilter, added a few tests and made them pass. Next up is to get the Population class done and then ITS DONE ÄNNA <3.
Hopefully it will be able to pass the XOR test from the paper... O_o

2018-16-17
Worked on the 'Population'-class, almost ready for the XOR test, didn't have the energy to write tests for the population class
will test manualy later. After finishing the Population class I need to write the XOR-test itself, propbz as a test-class.
