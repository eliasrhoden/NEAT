New name on project, "Rockwell".
Need to complete the 'MutatorTest' before starting to implement the newly tested functions.

2018-01-21
Make the tests for 'Mutator' to pass. (May also need to write more tests for 'Mutator')

2018-01-28
Added new function to genome, getNodeSUpplyers, needed later to avoid create loop-conection genes during mutation.
Mutator is gonna need some refractoring/Clean-up, can tell that duplicated code is coming up...
The mutator tests may need to be looked-over, but should be ok. Ready to implemetn the LAST PARTS OF MUTATOR½!!

Got the three Mutator tests to pass (testNewNode, innovationNumber, newConnection). So I think 'New Node' and 'New Connection'
mutations are working. Next up is to write tests for the other mutations, maybe also write more tests for the above mentioned
mutations as well, 3 tests doesn't feel too trustworthy... PRogräss änna!

2018-05-27
Finished working on the mutator, didn't add more tests (Brinner in the knutarna änna), started working on the GenomeCrossover,
need to finnish its tests and implement it. After that some spieces functionality need to be done and after that its just to
implement the 'Population', gettin closeeee.
