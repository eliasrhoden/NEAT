(@_@) NEAT AI

My take at implementing an NEAT AI Engine. More info about NeuroEvolution
of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) at: http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf

Currently it's able to pass the XOR-test, described in the paper abowe.

Evolving Neural Networks through
Augmenting Topologies

No intention to be used as a library, just a project to learn more about AI, neurual netowrks, deep learning and AI.
